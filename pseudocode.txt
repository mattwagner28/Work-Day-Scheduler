Pseudocode for button click iteration 

Before click:
- a variable is created for button's parent index number

When any button is clicked:
- a loop creates a new array to hold the text in each textarea
- if i === button clicked, then new storage item is created

After it is stored
- create loop through each div index again
- variable for every stored item

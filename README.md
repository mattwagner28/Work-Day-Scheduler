# Work-Day-Scheduler
For homework assignment #5 of my bootcamp, we had to write code to make a fully functioning work day scheduler to practice using day.js, and jQuery functions. The scheduler features user input sections for each hour of the work day. The user is able to save the input for each hour to local storage, and so the data will stay on the page even if it is refreshed, or closed and opened again later. The hours of the day also automatically change color based on the time of day. So, the current hour will be highlighted in red; past hours are gray; and future hours are in green.

# Notes/Anticipated Updates
It would be nice to eventually add a button that easily clears the scheduler.
